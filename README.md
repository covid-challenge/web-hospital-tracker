#HospitALL

## Summary

"Which Hospital should I go?" is one of the frequently asked questions during the COVID-19 crisis. 

Concerns over the spread of COVID-19 has impacted the healthcare system by being overwhelmed with tasks of providing health care to people who may have the virus. Many COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients are being refused by hospitals due to the limited workforce and capacity. 

Our goal is to develop a mobile and web application to provide solutions to these issues.

## How We Addressed This Challenge

As we battle COVID-19 more and more people are being left out, from refusals of hospitals to both COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients and to lack of PPEs. We at Helius want to address this issue through the use of technology, by utilizing NASA and Health Department's data, our web and mobile application locates hospitals that are designated for COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients and determine which health care facilities that are in need of assistance.

Our goal is to ensure that NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND.
